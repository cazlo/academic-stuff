DESCRIPTION: Readme for project

About project:
For project description see the pdfs in the doc folder.

Environment Setup:
You should extract the zip containing this file to some folder (let's call it <root>) in a unix environment such as cs2.utdallas.edu.  To setup the environment for this program, simply change directory to the <root> folder.

Compiling:
I have provided a fancy compile script which does it for you.  Run it with /bin/sh compile.sh
If you don't want to run this, you can follow the following manual steps.
1) javac -d . simpleNetworkSim/*.java

Running:
I have supplied a sample script called scenario.sh.  This script removes old channel and log files, then creates nodes for the 3 different test scenarios posted.  Just comment/ uncomment lines to suit test scenario needs. There is a lot of debug info produced by each node, so if you choose not to use this script exactly, I would recommend still redirecting standard out to a log file.
